# Hey, this is the script of your new tool.

# It's easy to create tool.

# - Get selected text from stdin
# - Write result to stdout
# - Write errors to stderr
# - Exit with non-zero exit code to prevent applying on error
# - Get arguments from command line

# Here is example:

from sys import stdin, stdout, stderr, argv

# Read from stdin...
input_string = stdin.read()

# ...process string...
output_string = 'You said "' + input_string + '"'

# IMPORTANT: trailing newline isn't ignored, so you shouldn't
# print it if you don't really want it to be in result string.

# ...handle errors...
if len(output_string) > 30:
    stderr.write('The message is too long')
    exit(1)

# ...and write result to stdout
stdout.write(output_string)

# You can use any language, not only Python.
# Just replace comand in first line with
# other the interpreter. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix))

# Compiled languages is not supported, but
# if you *really* want, you can put any
# binary to this script location
